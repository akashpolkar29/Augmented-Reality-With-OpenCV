# Augmented-Reality-With-OpenCV
This project demonstrates the implementation of Augmented Reality (AR) using OpenCV and ArUco markers for image transformation and overlay. The goal is to detect ArUco markers in a live image and apply a perspective transformation to overlay another image (such as a display or graphical content) onto the detected marker.
